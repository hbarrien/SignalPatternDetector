Signal Pattern Detector   
========================================================   
## PROBLEM STATEMENT   
   
Instruments produce signals which describe machine usage behavior based on certain events. On a timeline, the signals may present patterns of interest. Finding these patterns, identifying them, and later reusing them for different purposes is the challenge at hand.

## SOLUTION DESCRIPTION   
   
SIGNAL is an application capable of accepting signal data and visually presenting it to end users, so signal portions that represent patterns can be easily identified and labeled. The labeled portions are stored in a persistent medium for later retrieval and use.

## OBJECTIVES   
1. To accept signal data in csv format and visually present an entire series.  
   
2. To allow the user to identify a signal pattern of interest and label it.   
   
3. To store a selected signal pattern in a persistent medium.   
   
4. To allow the user to fetch a previously stored label, and once found, visually present the corresponding signal portion.
